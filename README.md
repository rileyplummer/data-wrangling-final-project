## General Information
- For this project, we used R to combine a Kaggle dataset and external data we researched. We performed analysis using linear regression, Shapiro-Wilk normality test, ANOVA, and a Kruskal-Wallis test. 
- This analysis gave us insight on different factors that lead to a student's high stress level and which factors that are positively and negatively correlated with student life satisfaction. 



## Technologies Used
- R



## Features
- R file with scraping and analysis code
- Project Proposal file outlining main idea
